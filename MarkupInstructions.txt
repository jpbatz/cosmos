2.  Styles
    Create a directory called /stylesheets

    In your index.html, link to your styles.css.
    
    Style the layout (do not touch the markup[HTML]).
    
    
    You can use my example as a guideline, or your own images/styles.
    - use at least 1 Google font in your document.
    - use at least 1 background image
    - use a border somewhere
    - add some styles to some hover states of items
    - advanced: add animations/transitions
