1.  Finish "Out of this World" markup.
 
2.  Styles
    x Create a directory called /stylesheets
    x In your /stylesheets directory, create a stylesheet called styles.css
    x In your index.html, link to your styles.css.
    
    Style the layout (do not touch the markup[HTML]).
    
    
    You can use my example as a guideline, or your own images/styles.
    x- use at least 1 Google font in your document.
    x - use at least 1 background image
    x - use a border somewhere
    x - add some styles to some hover states of items
    - advanced: add animations/transitions
 
    Not allowed: Float Property.

3.  Nav & Dropdown Subnav

    x Create a new branch called 'subnav' (nav_section)

    x Add a CSS Reset at the TOP of your styles.css (after the @import and before all your other code)

    Style the Nav (you can adjust the markup if you need to)
    
    Advanced: Make a dropdown nav. (No copying from the internet!)
    Superadvanced: Make a fancy dropdown nav with an animation/transition.

    4.  [ NEW BRANCH ] Multi-Column Layouts
    - remove all padding, border, and margin styles from <section> and <aside>
    - Add a clearfix hack to the top of your stylesheet.
    - Add markup to your index.html to make sure <section> and <aside> are contained inside a parent div called #layout.
    - Apply the clearfix hack to the parent div #layout.
    - Make the a 2-column layout 
        - your floating elements must have a width property[probably %], and a float property.
        - make the floating elements have the box-sizing property of border-box.
    
    - Remember the Rules!
        Rule #1: Don't mix floating and non-floating siblings (unless you are floating an image inside a block of text).
        Rule #2: Floating things must have a width property & valye (usually %).
        Rule #3: The parent of floating elements must have a clearfix class.
    
* Note: This is the "old-school" way of making multi-column layouts. There are new shinier ways to accomplish this now, however they work for IE10+ or have restrictions on their use. See flex-box layouts, and table layouts for these new, shinier methods.
